        Using the interface was a little bit easier to work with. Since almost
        all of the code was provided, I mostly just needed to set up the abstract
        methods in the interface class. Using the interface is much better because
        I dont need to worry about inheriting bad code, all of the code is created
        within the subclasses.
    
        Liskov Substitution principle can also be used in the class, It makes methods
        easier to call without having errors
